Because of it, we need to fill all\n * empty elements which should be selectable with elements or characters called \"fillers\". Unfortunately there is no one\n * universal filler, this is why two types are uses:\n *\n * * Block filler is an element which fill block elements, like `<p>`. CKEditor uses `<br>` as a block filler during the editing,\n * as browsers do natively. So instead of an empty `<p>` there will be `<p><br></p>`. The advantage of block filler is that\n * it is transparent for the selection, so when the caret is before the `<br>` and user presses right arrow he will be\n * moved to the next paragraph, not after the `<br>`. The disadvantage is that it breaks a block, so it can not be used\n * in the middle of a line of text. The {@link module:engine/view/filler~BR_FILLER `<br>` filler} can be replaced with any other\n * character in the data output, for instance {@link module:engine/view/filler~NBSP_FILLER non-breaking space}.\n *\n * * Inline filler is a filler which does not break a line of text, so it can be used inside the text, for instance in the empty\n * `<b>` surrendered by text: `foo<b></b>bar`, if we want to put the caret there. CKEditor uses a sequence of the zero-width\n * spaces as an {@link module:engine/view/filler~INLINE_FILLER inline filler} having the predetermined\n * {@link module:engine/view/filler~INLINE_FILLER_LENGTH length}. A sequence is used, instead of a single character to\n * avoid treating random zero-width spaces as the inline filler. Disadvantage of the inline filler is that it is not\n * transparent for the selection. The arrow key moves the caret between zero-width spaces characters, so the additional\n * code is needed to handle the caret.\n *\n * Both inline and block fillers are handled by the {@link module:engine/view/renderer~Renderer renderer} and are not present in the\n * view.\n *\n * @module engine/view/filler\n */\n\n/**\n * Non-breaking space filler creator.

When the visible view is removed from the stack,\n * the previous view becomes visible.\n *\n * It might be useful to implement nested navigation in a balloon. For instance, a toolbar view may contain a link button.\n * When you click it, a link view (which lets you set the URL) is created and put on top of the toolbar view, so the link panel\n * is displayed. When you finish editing the link and close (remove) the link view, the toolbar view is visible again.\n *\n * However, there are cases when there are multiple independent balloons to be displayed, for instance, if the selection\n * is inside two inline comments at the same time. For such cases, you can create two independent panel stacks.\n * The contextual balloon plugin will create a navigation bar to let the users switch between these panel stacks using the \"Next\"\n * and \"Previous\" buttons.\n *\n * If there are no views in the current stack, the balloon panel will try to switch to the next stack. If there are no\n * panels in any stack, the balloon panel will be hidden.\n *\n * **Note**: To force the balloon panel to show only one view, even if there are other stacks, use the `singleViewMode=true` option\n * when {@link module:ui/panel/balloon/contextualballoon~ContextualBalloon#add adding} a view to a panel.\n *\n * From the implementation point of view, the contextual ballon plugin is reusing a single\n * {@link module:ui/panel/balloon/balloonpanelview~BalloonPanelView} instance to display multiple contextual balloon\n * panels in the editor.

In this situation, webpack will know that it only needs to load each plugin once.\n\t *\n\t * Read more in the {@glink builds/guides/integration/installing-plugins \"Installing plugins\"} guide.\n\t *\n\t * # Confused an editor build with an editor implementation\n\t *\n\t * This scenario is very similar to the previous one, but has a different origin.\n\t *\n\t * Let's assume that you wanted to use CKEditor 5 from source, as explained in the\n\t * {@glink builds/guides/integration/advanced-setup#scenario-2-building-from-source \"Building from source\"} section\n\t * or in the {@glink framework/guides/quick-start \"Quick start\"} guide of CKEditor 5 Framework.\n\t *\n\t * The correct way to do so is to import an editor and plugins and run them together like this:\n\t *\n\t *\t\timport ClassicEditor from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-editor-classic/src/classiceditor';\n\t *\t\timport Essentials from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-essentials/src/essentials';\n\t *\t\timport Paragraph from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-paragraph/src/paragraph';\n\t *\t\timport Bold from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-basic-styles/src/bold';\n\t *\t\timport Italic from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-basic-styles/src/italic';\n\t *\n\t *\t\tClassicEditor\n\t *\t\t\t.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ), {\n\t *\t\t\t\tplugins: [ Essentials, Paragraph, Bold, Italic ],\n\t *\t\t\t\ttoolbar: [ 'bold', 'italic' ]\n\t *\t\t\t} )\n\t *\t\t\t.then( editor => {\n\t *\t\t\t\tconsole.log( 'Editor was initialized', editor );\n\t *\t\t\t} )\n\t *\t\t\t.catch( error => {\n\t *\t\t\t\tconsole.error( error.stack );\n\t *\t\t\t} );\n\t *\n\t * However, you might have mistakenly imported a build instead of the source `ClassicEditor`. In this case\n\t * your imports will look like this:\n\t *\n\t *\t\timport ClassicEditor from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-classic';\n\t *\t\timport Essentials from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-essentials/src/essentials';\n\t *\t\timport Paragraph from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-paragraph/src/paragraph';\n\t *\t\timport Bold from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-basic-styles/src/bold';\n\t *\t\timport Italic from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-basic-styles/src/italic';\n\t *\n\t * This creates the same situation as in the previous section because you use a build together with source plugins.\n\t *\n\t * Remember: `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-*` packages contain editor builds and `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-editor-*` contain source editors.\n\t *\n\t * # Loading two or more builds on one page\n\t *\n\t * If you use CKEditor 5 builds, you might have loaded two (or more) `ckeditor.js` files on one web page.\n\t * Check your web page for duplicated `<script>` elements or make sure your page builder/bundler includes CKEditor only once.\n\t *\n\t * If you want to use two different types of editors at once, see the\n\t * {@glink builds/guides/integration/advanced-setup#scenario-3-using-two-different-editors \"Using two different editors\"}\n\t * section.\n\t *\n\t * # Using outdated packages\n\t *\n\t * Building CKEditor 5 from source requires using multiple npm packages. These packages have their dependencies\n\t * to other packages. If you use the latest version of, for example, `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-editor-classic` with\n\t * an outdated version of `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-image`, npm or yarn will need to install two different versions of\n\t * `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-core` because `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-editor-classic` and `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-image` may require\n\t * different versions of the core package.\n\t *\n\t * The solution to this issue is to update all packages to their latest version. We recommend\n\t * using tools like [`node-check-updates`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates) which simplify this process.\n\t *\n\t * # Conflicting version of dependencies\n\t *\n\t * This is a special case of the previous scenario. If you use CKEditor 5 with some third-party plugins,\n\t * it may happen that even if you use the latest versions of the official packages and the latest version of\n\t * these third-party packages, there will be a conflict between some of their dependencies.\n\t *\n\t * Such a problem can be resolved by either downgrading CKEditor 5 packages (which we do not recommend) or\n\t * asking the author of the third-party package to upgrade its depdendencies (or forking their project and doing this yourself).\n\t *\n\t * **Note:** All official CKEditor 5 packages (excluding integrations and `ckeditor5-dev-*` packages) are released in the\n\t * same major version. This is &mdash; in the `x.y.z`, the `x` is the same for all packages. This is the simplest way to check\n\t * whether you use packages coming from the same CKEditor 5 version. You can read more about versioning in the\n\t * {@glink framework/guides/support/versioning-policy Versioning policy} guide.\n\t *\n\t * # Packages were duplicated in `node_modules`\n\t *\n\t * In some situations, especially when calling `npm install` multiple times, it may happen\n\t * that npm will not correctly \"deduplicate\" packages.\n\t *\n\t * Normally, npm deduplicates all packages so, for example, `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-core` is installed only once in `node_modules/`.\n\t * However, it is known to fail to do so from time to time.\n\t *\n\t * We recommend checking if any of the steps listed below help:\n\t *\n\t * * `rm -rf node_modules && npm install` to make sure you have a clean `node_modules/` directory. This step\n\t * is known to help in most cases.\n\t * * If you use `yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json`, remove it before `npm install`.\n\t * * Check whether all CKEditor 5 packages are up to date and reinstall them\n\t * if you changed anything (`rm -rf node_modules && npm install`).\n\t *\n\t * If all packages are correct and compatible with each other, the steps above are known to help. If not, you may\n\t * try to check with `npm ls` how many times packages like `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-core`, `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine` and\n\t *`@ckeditor/ckeditor5-utils` are installed. If more than once, verify which package causes that.\n\t *\n\t * @error ckeditor-duplicated-modules\n\t */\n\tthrow new CKEditorError(\n\t\t'ckeditor-duplicated-modules: Some CKEditor 5 modules are duplicated.',\n\t\tnull\n\t);\n} else {\n\twindowOrGlobal.CKEDITOR_VERSION = version;\n}\n","import baseGetAllKeys from './_baseGetAllKeys.js';\nimport getSymbols from './_getSymbols.js';\nimport keys from './keys.js';\n\n/**\n * Creates an array of own enumerable property names and symbols of `object`.\n *\n * @private\n * @param {Object} object The object to query.\n * @returns {Array} Returns the array of property names and symbols.\n */\nfunction getAllKeys(object) {\n  return baseGetAllKeys(object, keys, getSymbols);\n}\n\nexport default getAllKeys;\n","/**\n * @license Copyright (c) 2003-2020, CKSource - Frederico Knabben.

Callbacks listening to those events are called converters. Those\n * converters role is to convert the model changes to changes in view (for example, adding view nodes or\n * changing attributes on view elements).\n *\n * During conversion process, `DowncastDispatcher` fires events, basing on state of the model and prepares\n * data for those events. It is important to understand that those events are connected with changes done on model,\n * for example: \"node has been inserted\" or \"attribute has changed\". This is in a contrary to upcasting (view to model conversion),\n * where we convert view state (view nodes) to a model tree.\n *\n * The events are prepared basing on a diff created by {@link module:engine/model/differ~Differ Differ}, which buffers them\n * and then passes to `DowncastDispatcher` as a diff between old model state and new model state.\n *\n * Note, that because changes are converted there is a need to have a mapping between model structure and view structure.\n * To map positions and elements during downcast (model to view conversion) use {@link module:engine/conversion/mapper~Mapper}.\n *\n * `DowncastDispatcher` fires following events for model tree changes:\n *\n * * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:insert insert}\n * if a range of nodes has been inserted to the model tree,\n * * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:remove remove}\n * if a range of nodes has been removed from the model tree,\n * * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:attribute attribute}\n * if attribute has been added, changed or removed from a model node.\n *\n * For {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:insert insert}\n * and {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:attribute attribute},\n * `DowncastDispatcher` generates {@link module:engine/conversion/modelconsumable~ModelConsumable consumables}.\n * These are used to have a control over which changes has been already consumed. It is useful when some converters\n * overwrite other or converts multiple changes (for example converts insertion of an element and also converts that\n * element's attributes during insertion).\n *\n * Additionally, `DowncastDispatcher` fires events for {@link module:engine/model/markercollection~Marker marker} changes:\n *\n * * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:addMarker} if a marker has been added,\n * * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:removeMarker} if a marker has been removed.\n *\n * Note, that changing a marker is done through removing the marker from the old range, and adding on the new range,\n * so both those events are fired.\n *\n * Finally, `DowncastDispatcher` also handles firing events for {@link module:engine/model/selection model selection}\n * conversion:\n *\n * * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:selection}\n * which converts selection from model to view,\n * * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:attribute}\n * which is fired for every selection attribute,\n * * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:addMarker}\n * which is fired for every marker which contains selection.\n *\n * Unlike model tree and markers, events for selection are not fired for changes but for selection state.\n *\n * When providing custom listeners for `DowncastDispatcher` remember to check whether given change has not been\n * {@link module:engine/conversion/modelconsumable~ModelConsumable#consume consumed} yet.\n *\n * When providing custom listeners for `DowncastDispatcher` keep in mind that any callback that had\n * {@link module:engine/conversion/modelconsumable~ModelConsumable#consume consumed} a value from a consumable and\n * converted the change should also stop the event (for efficiency purposes).\n *\n * When providing custom listeners for `DowncastDispatcher` remember to use provided\n * {@link module:engine/view/downcastwriter~DowncastWriter view downcast writer} to apply changes to the view document.\n *\n * Example of a custom converter for `DowncastDispatcher`:\n *\n *\t\t// We will convert inserting \"paragraph\" model element into the model.\n *\t\tdowncastDispatcher.on( 'insert:paragraph', (

In contrary to {@link module:engine/model/node~Node nodes}, which are building blocks of\n * model document tree, markers are not stored directly in document tree but in\n * {@link module:engine/model/model~Model#markers model markers' collection}. Still, they are document data, by giving\n * additional meaning to the part of a model document between marker start and marker end.\n *\n * In this sense, markers are similar to adding and converting attributes on nodes. The difference is that attribute is\n * connected with a given node (e.g. a character is bold no matter if it gets moved or content around it changes).\n * Markers on the other hand are continuous ranges and are characterized by their start and end position. This means that\n * any character in the marker is marked by the marker. For example, if a character is moved outside of marker it stops being\n * \"special\" and the marker is shrunk. Similarly, when a character is moved into the marker from other place in document\n * model, it starts being \"special\" and the marker is enlarged.\n *\n * Another upside of markers is that finding marked part of document is fast and easy. Using attributes to mark some nodes\n * and then trying to find that part of document would require traversing whole document tree. Marker gives instant access\n * to the range which it is marking at the moment.\n *\n * Markers are built from a name and a range.\n *\n * Range of the marker is updated automatically when document changes, using\n * {@link module:engine/model/liverange~LiveRange live range} mechanism.\n *\n * Name is used to group and identify markers. Names have to be unique, but markers can be grouped by\n * using common prefixes, separated with `:`, for example: `user:john` or `search:3`. That's useful in term of creating\n * namespaces for custom elements (e.g. comments, highlights). You can use this prefixes in\n * {@link module:engine/model/markercollection~MarkerCollection#event:update} listeners to listen on changes in a group of markers.\n * For instance: `model.markers.on( 'update:user', callback );` will be called whenever any `user:*` markers changes.\n *\n * There are two types of markers.\n *\n * 1. Markers managed directly, without using operations. They are added directly by {@link module:engine/model/writer~Writer}\n * to the {@link module:engine/model/markercollection~MarkerCollection} without any additional mechanism.

Currently, the supported modifications are:\n *\n * * Extending. The selection focus is moved in the specified `options.direction` with a step specified in `options.unit`.\n * Possible values for `unit` are:\n *  * `'character'` (default) - moves selection by one user-perceived character. In most cases this means moving by one\n *  character in `String` sense. However, unicode also defines \"combing marks\". These are special symbols, that combines\n *  with a symbol before it (\"base character\") to create one user-perceived character. For example, `q̣̇` is a normal\n *  letter `q` with two \"combining marks\": upper dot (`Ux0307`) and lower dot (`Ux0323`). For most actions, i.e. extending\n *  selection by one position, it is correct to include both \"base character\" and all of it's \"combining marks\". That is\n *  why `'character'` value is most natural and common method of modifying selection.\n *  * `'codePoint'` - moves selection by one unicode code point. In contrary to, `'character'` unit, this will insert\n *  selection between \"base character\" and \"combining mark\", because \"combining marks\" have their own unicode code points.\n *  However, for technical reasons, unicode code points with values above `UxFFFF` are represented in native `String` by\n *  two characters, called \"surrogate pairs\". Halves of \"surrogate pairs\" have a meaning only when placed next to each other.\n *  For example `𨭎` is represented in `String` by `\\uD862\\uDF4E`. Both `\\uD862` and `\\uDF4E` do not have any meaning\n *  outside the pair (are rendered as ? when alone). Position between them would be incorrect. In this case, selection\n *  extension will include whole \"surrogate pair\".\n *  * `'word'` - moves selection by a whole word.\n *\n * **Note:** if you extend a forward selection in a backward direction you will in fact shrink it.\n *\n * **Note:** Use {@link module:engine/model/model~Model#modifySelection} instead of this function.\n * This function is only exposed to be reusable in algorithms\n * which change the {@link module:engine/model/model~Model#modifySelection}\n * method's behavior.\n *\n * @param {module:engine/model/model~Model} model The model in context of which\n * the selection modification should be performed.\n * @param {module:engine/model/selection~Selection|module:engine/model/documentselection~DocumentSelection} selection\n * The selection to modify.\n * @param {Object} [options]\n * @param {'forward'|'backward'} [options.direction='forward'] The direction in which the selection should be modified.\n * @param {'character'|'codePoint'|'word'} [options.unit='character'] The unit by which selection should be modified.\n */\nexport default function modifySelection( model, selection, options = {} ) {\n\tconst schema = model.schema;\n\tconst isForward = options.direction != 'backward';\n\tconst unit = options.unit ? options.unit : 'character';\n\n\tconst focus = selection.focus;\n\n\tconst walker = new TreeWalker( {\n\t\tboundaries: getSearchRange( focus, isForward ),\n\t\tsingleCharacters: true,\n\t\tdirection: isForward ?

The selection focus is moved in the specified `options.direction` with a step specified in `options.unit`.\n\t * Possible values for `unit` are:\n\t *  * `'character'` (default) - moves selection by one user-perceived character. In most cases this means moving by one\n\t *  character in `String` sense. However, unicode also defines \"combing marks\". These are special symbols, that combines\n\t *  with a symbol before it (\"base character\") to create one user-perceived character. For example, `q̣̇` is a normal\n\t *  letter `q` with two \"combining marks\": upper dot (`Ux0307`) and lower dot (`Ux0323`). For most actions, i.e. extending\n\t *  selection by one position, it is correct to include both \"base character\" and all of it's \"combining marks\". That is\n\t *  why `'character'` value is most natural and common method of modifying selection.\n\t *  * `'codePoint'` - moves selection by one unicode code point. In contrary to, `'character'` unit, this will insert\n\t *  selection between \"base character\" and \"combining mark\", because \"combining marks\" have their own unicode code points.\n\t *  However, for technical reasons, unicode code points with values above `UxFFFF` are represented in native `String` by\n\t *  two characters, called \"surrogate pairs\".

We have `operationsA` and `operationsB` array, which we dynamically update as the transformation process goes.\n\t//\n\t// 2. We take next (or first) operation from `operationsA` and check from which operation `b` we need to start transforming it.\n\t// All original `operationsA` are set to be transformed starting from the first operation `b`.\n\t//\n\t// 3. We take operations from `operationsB`, one by one, starting from the correct one, and transform operation `a`\n\t// by operation `b` (and vice versa). We update `operationsA` and `operationsB` by replacing the original operations\n\t// with the transformation results.\n\t//\n\t// 4. If operation is broken into multiple operations, we save all the new operations in the place of the\n\t// original operation.\n\t//\n\t// 5. Additionally, if operation `a` was broken, for the \"new\" operation, we remember from which operation `b` it should\n\t// be transformed by.\n\t//\n\t// 6. We continue transforming \"current\" operation `a` until it is transformed by all `operationsB`. Then, go to 2.\n\t// unless the last operation `a` was transformed.\n\t//\n\t// The actual implementation of the above algorithm is slightly different, as only one loop (while) is used.\n\t// The difference is that we have \"current\" `a` operation to transform and we store the index of the next `b` operation\n\t// to transform by.
